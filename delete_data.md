To delete your recorded days from the server you need to:
  
1. In the application settings, go to manage account;
2. Click on the "Delete day entries" button;
3. In the dialog box that appears, click "Delete records";
4. After this your recorded days will be deleted from our server. On the server will remain only the data associated with your account: user name, email, password. 

Pay attention, that in this case records will be also deleted on your device! If you want to delete the data only on the server, use the delete account.
